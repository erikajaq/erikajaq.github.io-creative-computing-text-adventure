			YOUR FRIENDS ARE TORN APART. ONE AGREES WITH YOU AND WANTS TO EXPLORE THE FORREST WHILE THE OTHER PREFERS TO STAY IN THE MEADOW. THEY BEGIN TO ARGUE AND THEIR FIGHT ESCALATES, EVENTUALLY TURNING INTO A BOXING MATCH WHICH YOU ARE NOW OBLIGATED TO REFEREE. THE FIGHT LASTS MANY ROUNDS AND THE FOOD WAITING IN YOUR PICNIC BASKET GOES COLD.
